   - Contract templates: $2,000-3,000

### Recurring Costs (Monthly)

1. **Infrastructure**
   ```
   Monthly Infrastructure Cost =
   Base Infrastructure +
   (Number of Proxy IPs × $50) +
   (Additional Storage × $0.02/GB) +
   (Additional Network Transfer × $0.01/GB)
   ```

2. **Personnel**
   ```
   Monthly Personnel Cost =
   Technical Team Cost +
   Support Team Cost +
   Management Overhead (15% of team cost)
   ```

3. **Software and Tools**
   ```
   Monthly Software Cost =
   Development Tools +
   Monitoring Tools +
   Business Tools +
   (Number of Users × Per-User License Costs)
   ```

## TCO Calculation Examples

| **Total Year 1** | | **$846,336** |
| **Cost per verification** | $846,336 / (200K × 365) | **$0.012** |

## ROI Calculation

### Formula
```
ROI = ((Annual Revenue - Annual TCO) / Annual TCO) × 100
```

### ROI Examples (at $0.01 per verification)

#### Small Scale
```
Annual Revenue = 10,000 × 365 × $0.01 = $36,500
Annual TCO (Year 1) = $265,016
ROI = ((36,500 - 265,016) / 265,016) × 100 = -86.2%
```

#### Medium Scale
```
Annual Revenue = 50,000 × 365 × $0.01 = $182,500
Annual TCO (Year 1) = $506,376
ROI = ((182,500 - 506,376) / 506,376) × 100 = -64%
```

#### Large Scale
```
Annual Revenue = 200,000 × 365 × $0.01 = $730,000
Annual TCO (Year 1) = $846,336
ROI = ((730,000 - 846,336) / 846,336) × 100 = -13.7%
```

## Break-Even Analysis

### Formula
```
Break-Even Point (months) = One-Time Costs / Monthly Net Income
Monthly Net Income = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Operating Costs
```

### Break-Even Examples (at $0.01 per verification)

#### Small Scale
```
One-Time Costs = $35,000
Monthly Net Income = $3,042 - $19,168 = -$16,126
Cannot break even at current pricing
```

#### Medium Scale
```
One-Time Costs = $45,000
Monthly Net Income = $15,208 - $38,448 = -$23,240
Cannot break even at current pricing
```

#### Large Scale
```
One-Time Costs = $60,000
Monthly Net Income = $60,833 - $65,528 = -$4,695
Cannot break even at current pricing
```
